_A lean Unity demo that showcases a dynamic, interactive game prototype with advanced shader effects, environmental interactions, and intuitive player controls._

## Overview

Aurora Quest is a minimal yet polished demo built in Unity that demonstrates:
- **Dynamic Aurora Effects:** Custom shader-based visuals that simulate a moving aurora in the sky.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** A controllable player object that collects orbs and interacts with puzzle elements (doors) to progress.
- **Environmental Depth:** A terrain with proper colliders, additional environmental objects (trees, rocks), and a realistic skybox featuring clouds and a blue sky.
- **Technical Excellence:** Clean, modular code with clear physics integration and responsive camera controls.

This project was developed to showcase creative level design, shader programming, and rapid prototypingâ€”skills that are valuable for roles in game technology and creative software development.

## Features

- **Player Controller:** A Capsule-based player with simple movement (WASD) and jumping using Rigidbody physics.
- **Aurora Shader:** A custom shader (written in ShaderLab/HLSL) that creates an animated aurora effect.
- **Collectibles & Puzzle Mechanics:** Interactive spheres (collectibles) that, when gathered, trigger a door (barrier) to open.
- **Dynamic Environment:** Utilizes a Terrain object with colliders to simulate realistic ground, complemented by additional low-poly models for trees and rocks.
- **Camera Follow:** A smooth camera follow script that keeps the player centered and ensures an immersive view.
- **Skybox with Clouds:** A custom skybox material featuring cloud textures to enhance the overall ambiance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Unity Hub:** Download and install from [Unity Download Page](https://unity.com/download).
- **Unity Editor:** Use the latest LTS version (e.g., Unity 2023 LTS) with modules for your target platforms.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Recommended for scripting; install with the C# extension (or use Visual Studio Community).
